Lets create a container with -----> lec6/TechContainer.html
Heading (React/Angular/MongoDB/NodeJS)
some paragraph(related to heading)
Button 

Create container only once and resue it , and pass data dynamically using functions  

 lec6/TechContainer.html
 
 Task completed , check once ( lec6/TechContainer.html)

 ====> From Now on , In React ,whenever we want to create any UI then , we will always create it in a JS function only .  

 reason
 1) We can reuse the UI
 2) We can pass dynamic data to the UI


 React provdies us a way to call function in tag format inside JSX 

 <function name>  </function name>
 <function name/>


But for this you have to follow a rule 
Your function name should start with a capital letter -------
Lets implement the code with above Syntax ---------->  lec6/Tech2Container.html
-------------------------->  lec6/Tech2Container.html


 From Now on , In React ,whenever we want to create any UI then , 
 1) we will always create it in a JS function only .
2) Start the function name with capital letter
3) call function using <FunctionName>


Functional component in React

It is  a simple JS function whose name starts with a capital letter / uppercase and returns User Interface


In react there are 2 types of component in React
1) Functional Component (used in 95% cases)  ---> React officialy suggests to use functional components only
2) Class Component(old --> Not recommended to use ---> Outdated)


Components represents view on the webpage
React Application is a collection of components .
UI = collection of components .

React and Angular follows component based Architecture.
