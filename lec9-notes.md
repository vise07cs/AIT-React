Till now we created HTML file , added some basic code of HTML file , Babel script , react script and React DOM , 
also we created every componet in 1 file , suppose we want to create 100s of components


Now we can take help of tools lik vite , parcel 

They will help us create a Basic React Application 
They also help us to create optimized code for production 
They will also provide us internally one developement server using which we can start ,stop server 
This toool will also give us url to access our applicatin in any browser 
If we dont use tools , then we have to do everything manually---> creating react app everytime is time taking and not easy 

earlier CRA (create react app ) was used , now its not used ; insted vite ,parcel are used
